The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.Using this model,We will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

## Objectives in this project:
- Perform data cleaning on the dataset
- Make a EDA report 
- Visualize the distributions of various features and correlations between them
- Feature engineering to extract the correct features for the model
- Build a regression model to predict the outlet sales
- Recommend price changes for optimising future sales
- Implement 

##Approach used:
- 
- Use simple linear regression to achieve results
- Design WebApp using Flask
